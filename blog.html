        <h1>Local storage vs Session storage</h1>
        <p>localStorage and sessionStorage both extend Storage. There is no difference between them except for the intended "non-persistence" of sessionStorage.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>Local storage:</h3> 
           The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Session storage:</h3>
            sessionStorage, changes are only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the current page in that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the stored data is deleted.
