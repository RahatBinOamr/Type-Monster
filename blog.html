        <h1>Local storage vs Session storage</h1>
        <p>localStorage and sessionStorage both extend Storage. There is no difference between them except for the intended "non-persistence" of sessionStorage.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Local storage:</h3> 
               The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.

            <div>
                <h3>Session storage:</h3>
                sessionStorage, changes are only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the current page in that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the stored data is deleted.

        <h1>Global scope vs Local scope</h1>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Global scope:</h3>
                A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Local scope:</h3>
                In contrast to global variables, locally scoped ones are only visible within the function they are declared. Each function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and every variable declared in this scope is a local variable. That means that variables with the same name can be used in different functions. However, any effort to reference a local variable outside its scope will result in a Reference Error:

        <h1>How to work event loop in js</h1>
        <p> The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

        Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.</p>
